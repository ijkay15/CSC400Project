The name of the business is Sacred Ground Real Estate Services. 6506 Mendius Ave NE, Albuquerque, NM 87109.
THe phone # is 505-514-4283 for now and is my personal cell.

We are offering real estate inspection services to buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and mortgage brokers.These can be pre sale
 or post contract signing as well as home maintenance as in the case of the duct inspections.

We will be starting with complete home inspections, in floor duct inspections, and starting soon sewer line inspections. 
Future plans are for roof drone inspections, and radon inspections,

 I will send you an email with the business card and a copy of the duct inspection template. 
 I can't send the home inspection template because it is in an application. let me see what I can figure out.

We would like to see a picture similar to the one on the front of the business card and the Road Runner on the back which will be our logo.
We would like to see the same colors as are on the business card with maybe something in turquois
